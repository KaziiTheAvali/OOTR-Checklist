This vault is to be opened in obsidion. you will use \[\[]] to connect two locations (file names) together. connecting the two locations like this will connect them in the graph view 



Locations may not be the same name as the spoiler log however should make sence

you can use \- \[ ] to find checks. this will make a checkbox like below
- [ ] <- you will beable to input text here and it will cross off checks.
you can also just press enter. if the check is not part of a group you can put it in added witch has a blank checkbox ready for you
this will come with some checks already  based off of the 11/9/23 github of Dev-Rob with everything but enemy souls and enemy drops enabled, based off of spoiler. some checks may need to be changed, added, or removed. you can add items after the check name



this does not include master quest atm but i may make one for master quest
