# OOTR-Checklist
This is a check checklist and entrence randomizer. 
This requires obsidian to properly use and open. 
You will open this file as a vault 

This checklest is mostly a template based off of a 11/9/23 github of [Dev-Rob](https://github.com/rrealmuto/OoT-Randomizer) randomizer's and [an oot interactive map](https://ootmap.com/)

This does not track inventory nor is an actual tracker for anything however it will allow you to note down what you get aswell as link up notes (named as maps) in a node graph. so a inventory tracker is recomended 

if you want a item tracker for inventory you can find some here https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Trackers. these are amazing trackers. i personally suggst linso tracker (expecally on linux) however a lot of emotracker trackers are rather nice too.

instructions for how to add and remove checks are in the how to use

## HOW TO OPEN 
First Clone and unzip. it is suggested to place the template in a named folder for the randomizer or the seed number (if you plan on making this into its own template with editing you may want to keep it in thie folder to duplicate)

Next you click open folder as vault

lastly you find and open the folder in the prompt (this will depend on your system and folder stuff)
